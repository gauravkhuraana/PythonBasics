We have to give a session to managers who are not hands on but want to learn AI hands on

This session is for introduction and we have shortlisted below topics

Python for AI intro, environment setup, venv creation, requirements.txt & pip install, .env secrets, 
AI API call, JSON handling, debugging basics, hands-on, Agent creation


we have 1 hour for the session, so we need to prioritize the topics and make sure we cover the essentials while keeping it engaging for the managers. Here's a suggested agenda for the session:

Also we need to have 2 labs which should have a target and help them in learning the concepts effectively.

Wwe need to give prequisite materials before the session so that they can come prepared and make the most out of the session.- example python installation guide
